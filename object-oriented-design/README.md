## Software Architect and Design Role in the Industry
- software design looks at the lower-level aspects of a system.
- software architecture looks at the higher-level aspects of a system.

> In common layman's definitions, I think a software architect is more like a real architect, just the system's blueprints. 
> While the software designer is more of an interior designer. They focus more on the specifics of the system. The chairs, the paint products, the framework to use in the system etc.

## Object-Oriented Thinking
What is Object-Oriented Modeling? Object-oriented modelling involves representing key concepts through objects in your software when solving a problem. Depending on the problem, many concepts, even instances of people, places, or things become distinct objects in the software.

## Design in the Software Process
- taking time to form requirements and design is statistically proven to help finish the completion or development of a system

Example of the process:
- system requirements
- conceptual designs
- technical designs

### Expressing Requirements with User Stories
One technique for expressing requirements is with a user story. A user story looks like this:

`As a _____, I want to _____ so that _____`

For example:
"As an online shopper, I want to add an item to my cart so that I can purchase it"
From the user story above, thinking in an object-oriented design, you can easily deduce that the object is an online shopper, item and cart. And the actions or methods are adding item and purchasing it.
